# Jupyter Notebook Accessibility

## Jupyter Notebook Accessibility Checker

The DataHub team developed an [accessibility checker](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/jupyterlab-a11y-checker) for Jupyter Notebooks. This checker can identify and either suggest fixes for accessibility issues or provide an interface for you to fix issues yourself. A list of the accessibility issues this checker can aid with is [here](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/jupyterlab-a11y-checker/blob/main/doc/rules.md).

You can access the accessibility checker on the [Accessibility DataHub](https://a11y.datahub.berkeley.edu/). Click on the following icon on the right hand side of the window. Then, click "Analyze Notebook".

Feel free to experiment with the AI included, but note that the models aren't among the most powerful and may not be the most useful for generating alt text.

## General Jupyter Accessibility 

Unforuntately, Jupyter software is not inherently accessible. [Check here](https://jupyter-accessibility.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to see the status of the Jupyter project's accessibility efforts.

## Accessibility at Berkeley

View the [Digital Accessibility Program's webpage](https://dap.berkeley.edu/) for the most up-to-date guidance on general accessibility at Berkeley and clarity on the standards.
