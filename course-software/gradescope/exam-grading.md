# Exam Grading

This section will outline the specific protocols pertaining to grading exams on Gradescope, but the tips
will be useful for written assignment grading as well.

## Creating an Outline

For all structured exams, Gradescope will ask you to upload a PDF of the exam to create an outline.
Part of this includes finding which region of the exam you want the question to encompass.
