## Tools for Writing Exams

Many tools have been used over the years for writing exams, including:

- Latex, typically using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for its in-browser editor, compiler, and previewer and its collaboration features
- CS 61A's [examtool](https://pypi.org/project/examtool/) which is a combination of tools:
    - The now deprecated examtool web app which allowed students to take exams online
    - The examtool CLI which allows instructors/TAs to compile exams from .md and .tex files to PDF
    - The examtool Markdown syntax
- [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com/)
- Most recently, [Typst](https://typst.app/), a Latex and Overleaf alternative, has been gaining popularity for its in-browser editor, compiler, and previewer and its local features
    - CS 61C has a Typst exam template [61c-examst](https://github.com/61c-teach/cs61c-examst) developed by Andrew Liu (liu.andrew@)
