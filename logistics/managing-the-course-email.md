# Managing the Course Email

Every course has a course email, also called the course [SPA (special purpose account)](https://calnet.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa), to manage official email communications. Although they seem like
regular @berkeley.edu email accounts, they are actually shared amongst multiple CalNet users.

- [How to give someone access to the SPA](https://calnet.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa/managing-spa-membership-calgroups)

## Best Practices

- **Respond to emails within 1-2 business days.** It should be the job of the professor(s) and head TA(s) to monitor the course email.
- **Use a vacation auto-responder during academic holidays.** Don't respond to emails on the weekend or holidays unless there is an emergency. Train students to wait for a response during regular business hours.
