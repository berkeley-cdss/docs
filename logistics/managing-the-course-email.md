# Managing Course Email

Most courses have a course email, also called the course [SPA (special purpose account)](https://calnet.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa), to manage official email communications. Although they seem like
regular @berkeley.edu email accounts, they are actually shared amongst multiple CalNet users.

## Best Practices

- **Respond to emails within 1-2 business days.** It should be the job of the professor(s) and head TA(s) to monitor the course email.
- **Use a vacation auto-responder during academic holidays.** Don't respond to emails on the weekend or holidays unless there is an emergency. Train students to wait for a response during regular business hours.
- **Not every TA needs access to the SPA.** Talk with your instructor about who needs access to the SPA and why. It may be useful to document for your course which roles require SPA access (and why).
- **Add the SPA to important shared accounts when appropriate.** This may include DNS administration, Docker Hub, GCP or AWS projects. Talk with your instructor about when to do so.
