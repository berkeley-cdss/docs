# Edstem Tips and Tricks

[Edstem](https://edstem.org), or Ed for short, is the online course Q&A forum used at UC Berkeley.
Many TAs know the basic functionality of Ed posts, but here are some lesser known tips and tricks.

## Additional Features

Ed will often have additional (beta) features you can optionally turn on. For example, the Chats feature
sets up a Slack-like interface with channels so students, TAs, and instructors can talk to each other.

## Ping other staff

Ping other staff using @ mentions.

## Bots

Create Ed bots.

## Callouts

Add callouts when you want to emphasize certain text (e.g. give a warning/danger note).

## Mark threads as duplicate, decline threads, or lock threads

- Mark threads as duplicate to redirect student to a post that already has the answer they're looking for
- Decline threads if they don't follow your template
- Lock threads if the discussion gets heated or if you have a post you don't want comments on (e.g. a course index post)

You can write a template message for declining threads in your course settings:

## Latex

You can write Latex if you need to write mathematical symbols:

## Runnable Code Blocks

You can post runnable code blocks with line numbers:

## Saved Replies

Find yourself saying the same thing to students over and over again? Use Saved Replies! Set them up in your course settings:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/edstem/saved-replies-setup.png" width="500px" alt="setup saved reply">

And then use them when responding:

## Visible to staff only

Want to talk amongst staff members on Ed without students seeing? Check the "Visible to staff only" box:

## Mark as spoiler

Want to hide some information from students unless they click to open the dropdown menu? Use the Spoiler feature:

This is what they'll see:
