# GitHub Features to Know

* Branches and [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) (PRs) allow your team to safely propose, review, and merge in changes to your GitHub repository
* [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) and [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) allow your team and even the public to write bug reports or feature requests and manage your todo list
* [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) lets you write workflows and automate software development processes, including continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD). Things you can do:
    * Write a CI workflow that lints the code you changed in your pull request
    * Write a CI workflow that automatically formats the code you changed in your pull request
    * Write a CI workflow that runs a [web accessibility checker](https://berkeley-cdss.github.io/berkeley-class-site/docs/a11y/) on your course website
    * Write a CD workflow that automatically deploys your website to GitHub Pages upon pushing to the `main` branch
* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) lets you create and deploy a website for free (this website uses it!)
* [GitHub Education](https://docs.github.com/en/education) has features like [GitHub Classroom](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/get-started-with-github-classroom/about-github-classroom) which can let you create and manage digital classrooms and assignments. For example, you can create starter code GitHub repositories and have students make their own copy.
* Don't like using the `git` CLI? You can install [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) and perform `git` commands using a GUI instead.
* Don't like having to switch between your terminal (for `git`) and your browser (for GitHub)? You can use the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli) to perform GitHub operations in your terminal without context switching.
