# Licenses

{: .important }
**Please, please, please license your public GitHub repositories.** This protects your intellectual property
and governs how any code you produce for your course can be used by others.

For brand new repositories, we suggest using a [BSD-3 License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause). We will not re-do the work of many others who have written on the subject of choosing an open source license, so check out [GitHub's article](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) or search around for yourself. **We highly recommend that all public repositories have an open source license.** Think of open source as the norm and the default, and think carefully when considering going against this norm.

If you're starting with a template from [berkeley-cdss](https://github.com/berkeley-cdss/) or previous repositories in a DATA course GitHub Organization, the materials you're working with should already be licensed. If you're working with a combination of already licensed materials, ensure that any additional licenses you choose are [compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility).

We do not provide any specific guidance on licensing private repositories.
