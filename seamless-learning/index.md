# Seamless Learning

The [Seamless Learning](https://github.com/berkeley-cdss/seamless-learning) initiative run by [Lisa Yan](https://github.com/yanlisa) (yanlisa@) and [Michael Ball](https://github.com/cycomachead) (ball@) is an essential place for gathering staff, TAs, and faculty to discuss common issues. The documentation here is a direct result of Seamless Learning's efforts.

All Seamless Learning tools are housed under the [berkeley-cdss](https://github.com/berkeley-cdss) GitHub organization.
Notable Seamless Learning projects are listed below.

You can message any of the contributors on Slack on EECS/DS Crossroads or email us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
