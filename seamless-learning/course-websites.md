# Course Websites

## Berkeley Class Site

The Berkeley Class Site template is a modern, web accessible, Jekyll-based static course website template forked from [Kevin Lin's just-the-class template](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class), which itself uses the [just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) theme.

It features all the benefits of Jekyll (fast development, builds, and GitHub Pages deployment) as well as Berkeley-specific
features such as a web accessibility GitHub Actions workflow and ready-to-use Jekyll collections for announcements,
lectures, assignments, and staff bios.
