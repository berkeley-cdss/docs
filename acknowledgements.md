# Acknowledgements

We'd like to thank [peyrin](https://github.com/peyrin) and others that have contributed to [CS 161's pedagogy site](https://pedagogy.cs161.org/) for recognizing the need for central documentation with CDSS and inspiring the creation of this site.

Seamless Learning run by [Lisa Yan](https://github.com/yanlisa) and [Michael Ball](https://github.com/cycomachead) is an essential place for gathering staff, TAs, and faculty to discuss common issues. The documentation here is a direct result of Seamless Learning's efforts.

We'd also like to thank all of the contributors to the software that our courses depend on, especially those helping maintain open source software.
